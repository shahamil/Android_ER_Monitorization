
Evaluating your service app requires a diverse set of metrics to truly understand its quality and impact. Here are some key categories and examples of product quality metrics PMs can use:

1. User Experience and Usability:

Net Promoter Score (NPS): Measures customer loyalty and how likely they are to recommend your app. Scores above 70 are considered good.
Task completion time: How long does it take users to complete key tasks within the app? Aim for efficient and speedy flows.
Error rate: Track how often users encounter errors or bugs. Aim for a low error rate and prompt fixes.
First click time: Measures how long it takes users to find what they need on the first click. Shorter times indicate intuitive design.
Session duration and frequency: Gauge user engagement by tracking how long they stay on the app and how often they return.
2. Performance and Reliability:

Uptime and downtime: Track the percentage of time your app is operational and available to users. Aim for near-perfect uptime.
Response time: Measure the time it takes for the app to respond to user actions. Faster response times lead to better user experience.
Crash rate: Track how often the app crashes unexpectedly. Aim for a minimal crash rate and swift resolution of crashes.
Resource usage: Monitor how much battery, data, and storage the app consumes. Optimize performance to minimize resource usage.
3. Customer Satisfaction and Retention:

Customer reviews and ratings: Gauge overall user sentiment through app store reviews and rating surveys. Address negative feedback promptly.
Customer churn rate: Track the percentage of users who stop using your app over time. Aim for a low churn rate and implement retention strategies.
Support ticket volume and resolution time: Monitor the number of support tickets received and the time it takes to resolve them. Aim for efficient and proactive customer support.
Active user engagement: Track how often users interact with key features and content within the app. High engagement indicates user satisfaction.
4. Business Impact and Growth:

Conversion rate: Track the percentage of users who take desired actions, such as signing up, making a purchase, or completing a task.
Average revenue per user (ARPU): Measure the average revenue generated from each active user.
User acquisition cost (CAC): Track the cost of acquiring new users. Maintain a healthy CAC-to-ARPU ratio.
App store ranking and growth: Monitor your app's ranking in relevant app stores and track its download and usage growth.
Remember, the specific metrics you choose will depend on your app's goals and target audience. It's essential to set realistic targets and track progress over time to identify areas for improvement and demonstrate the impact of your efforts.

Additionally, consider combining quantitative metrics with qualitative data through user surveys, interviews, and user testing to gain deeper insights into user experience and satisfaction.

By using a holistic approach to product quality metrics, you can continually improve your service app and deliver a valuable experience for your users.
